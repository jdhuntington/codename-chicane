Project Codename Chicane
========================

A music player for shared listening.

The goal of this project is to enable an office or otherwise
cohabitated environment to collectively share and listen to music. The
primary use case is for many users to load and queue music from their
own web browsers and play music using a single shared output device,
such as an AirPlay endpoint.
